## Tech

üóíÔ∏è next-notes uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Next.js: React framework for server-side rendering.
- TypeScript: Typed JavaScript for safer code.
- Auth.js: Authentication library for web applications.
- Y.js: Shared data types for building collaborative software.
- WebSocket: Realtime data-transfer using TipTap Cloud.
- TipTap: Suite of open source content editing and real-time collaboration .
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for scalable storage.
- Prisma: ORM for database management.
- TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework.
- shadcn: Styled component library for React.

## Installation

üóí Ô∏ènext-notes requires Next.js (https://nextjs.org/) v14 to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

## Environment Variables

#### 1) .env.local

I am using TipTap Cloud as my Websocket Backend as Vercel does not
support WebSocket Servers. You can create your own WebSocket server
and manage the documents and their connections manually.

If not using TipTap Cloud Server like me, remove last two env veriables
(NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID and NEXT_PUBLIC_JWT)

```sh
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
SENDER_GMAIL=
SENDER_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_JWT=
```

#### 2) .env

```sh
DATABASE_URL=
```

For testing production builds in local environments,
(if Next gives error)

```sh
NEXT_AUTH_HOST=
```

#### For development environments

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### For production environments...

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```
